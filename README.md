# aYa-Calendar
This application find common empty time list among many people

This is for assignment (final project : make your own program using oop concepts). I made this application using JAVA

Thanks for prof. Sungahn Ko giving great chance and teaching


aYa is am abbreviation of __'are You available?'__. The icon has a shape of coffee cup when we see it from above. This looks like alphabet _'a'_. The clock hands looks like alphabet _'Y'_. We designed this application in this way. Thanks for my friend Bae Euibin, we major in Human Factor Engineering. Also Thanks for Kim Yunju.
